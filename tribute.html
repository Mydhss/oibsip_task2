          <h1>About Stephen Hawking</h1>
          <p>
              Stephen William Hawking (1942-2018) was one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists in history. He is most known for his groundbreaking work in black holes; specifically about 'Hawking Radiation', a gradual loss of energy from black holes in the form of light particles. He defied the limitations of his ALS diagnosis to become an influential scientist and author. He was well known for his interest and research behind time travel, space exploration and his final theory which was about a 4 dimensional universe. His book "A Brief History of Time" became a global bestseller, bringing complex scientific concepts to the public in an accessible manner. Hawking's contributions to science, his courage, and his humor inspired millions around the world.

                <p>Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England, to his parents Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking. His parents were intellectuals who valued education and knowledge and studied in one of England's most prestigious institutions, University of Oxford. Hawking had two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward Frank David</p>

                <p>In 1963, at the age of 21, Hawking was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a motor neuron disease, and was given only a few years to live. Despite this, he continued his studies and pursued groundbreaking research. His disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics.</p>

              <section id="detail-1974" class="details-section">
                <p>In 1974, Hawking proposed the theory of Hawking Radiation, which suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit small amounts of radiation, eventually leading to their evaporation. Hawking also theorized that black holes are collapsed stars with infinite mass and zero volume, and that nothing can escape once it passes through them.</p>

              <section id="detail-1988" class="details-section">
                <p>Hawking published "A Brief History of Time" in 1988, making complex scientific concepts accessible to a global audience and earning widespread acclaim. In the book, he talks about basic concepts of space and time and how the universe was formed by quarks, gluons and gravity. His writing was very non-technical which made it easier for even beginners to understand and develop an interest in cosmology.</p>
